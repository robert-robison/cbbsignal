# Bayesian College Basketball Efficiency system

This is demo of a Bayesian efficiency system using Stan. It was tested using ACC basketball games from 2017-2018. The benefit of a Bayesian efficiency system is that it not only makes predictions for a final score, but includes uncertainty as well.

The figure below shows the credible intervals (blue) and the actual scoring margin (red) for game results played during March 2018.
